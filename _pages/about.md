## About Me

Hello! I am a Masters in Computer Science student at **Khoury College, Northeastern University**. I am currently in my second semester and have registered for the Deep Learning and Algorithms courses.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with Minors in Computational Intelligence from Manipal Institute of
Technology, Manipal, India in 2024. I am fortunate to have conducted my Bachelor's thesis at the School of Medical
Science and Technology Lab (SMST) at
Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur under the guidance
of [Prof. Subhamoy Mandal](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/MM/faculty/mm-smandal). Here, I worked in the
area of semantic image segmentation of the Humerus Bone in X-ray images.

My research interests lie in the area of Deep Learning, specifically Image Processing and Computer Vision. I have worked
specifically in the area of object detection, image segmentation, and motion analysis.

I am actively seeking internship opportunities starting in May 2025, where I can further develop my skills, collaborate
with talented teams, and contribute to innovative projects in the AI and computer vision fields.
