### Website is under construction ‚öíÔ∏è

I am a final year B.Tech. CSE student at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal with a specialisation in Computational Intelligence.

I am fortunate to be conducting my Bachelor's thesis at the School of Medical Science and Technology Lab (SMST) at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur under the guidance of [Prof. Subhamoy Mandal](https://www.iitkgp.acin/department/MM/faculty/mm-smandal). Here, I have been working in the area of semantic image segmentation.  

Simultaneously, I am also grateful to be working as a Research Assistant under the mentorship of [Prof. Sanjay Singh](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=VBj6NyUAAAAJ&hl=en) in the domain of Responsible-AI. 

My research interests lie in the area of Deep Learning, specifically Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I have also been experimenting with Vision Language Models and working on personal projects in this area.  

I am also in search for open-source projects where I can start my open-source contribution journey. If you have interesting ideas brewing in your mind, please ping me. I would love to collaborate and work on those projects together.
