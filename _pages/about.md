## About Me

Hello! I am a second semester Masters in Computer Science student at **Khoury College, Northeastern University** where I am fortunate to being advised by [Prof. Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/). 

I am currently working on a collaborative project with MathWorks under the guidance of [Prof. Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/) and [Dr. Aruni RoyChowdhury](https://arunirc.github.io/about/), focusing on visual odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).

Additionally, I am also working as a research assistant for [Prof. Anna Lamin](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/people/anna-lamin/) and [Prof. Valentina Marano](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/people/valentina-marano/) on a research project to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze and extract insights from Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activity of Indian companies, helping improve future CSR strategies.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (Minors in Computational Intelligence) from Manipal Institute of
Technology, India in 2024. I conducted my Bachelor's thesis at the School of Medical
Science and Technology Lab (SMST) at
Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur under the guidance
of [Prof. Subhamoy Mandal](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/MM/faculty/mm-smandal).

My research interests lie in areas like Computer Vision, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), Human Motion Generation and Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs).
