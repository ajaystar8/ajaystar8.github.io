👨🏽‍💻 I'm a final year undergraduate student at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal.

🔬 My research interests is in Deep Learning, specifically Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

📚 Currently, I'm doing my internship at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur in the area of semantic image segmentation.

🌱 I've recently started learning about and experimenting with Vision Language Models.

🤝 I would love to collaborate on interesting projects and participate in hackathons.

🕵️‍♂️ I am excited to join the open-source community and make significant contributions.
