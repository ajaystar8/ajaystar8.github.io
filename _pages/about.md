## About Me

Hello! I am a MSCS student at **Khoury College, Northeastern University**. I just completed my first semester, during which I took the courses of Programming Design Paradigms and Pattern Recognition & Computer Vision.  


I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with Minors in Computational Intelligence from Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal, India in 2024. I was fortunate enough to have conducted research under the guidance of [Dr. Nisha P Shetty](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o4fHE34AAAAJ), [Dr. Sanjay Singh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VBj6NyUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Srikanth Prabhu](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=iNwLHREAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I am fortunate to have conducting my Bachelor's thesis at the School of Medical Science and Technology Lab (SMST) at
Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur under the guidance
of [Prof. Subhamoy Mandal](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/MM/faculty/mm-smandal). Here, I worked in the
area of semantic image segmentation in X-ray images. 

My research interests lie in the area of Deep Learning, specifically Image Processing and Computer Vision. I have also been experimenting with Natural Language Processing and working towards building my experience in this domain. 

In my free time, I am in search for open-source projects where I can start my open-source contribution journey. If you have interesting ideas brewing in your mind, please ping me. I would love to collaborate and work together.
