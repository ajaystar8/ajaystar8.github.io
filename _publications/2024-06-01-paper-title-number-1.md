collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-06-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Implemented and trained BERT & XLNet to classify misinformation on custom datasets scraped from
Twitter and Reddit. Fine tuned the architectures to obtain a F1-Score of 0.92 for BERT & 0.93 for XLNet. Implemented a user association mapping algorithm based on cosine similarity to identify dense conversation clusters, analyze conversations and flag suspicious users. 

The codebase is made publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ajaystar8/Vaccine_Misinformation_Project). The paper can be downloaded [Here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050924008470).'
